===

Time to introduce a router!

Your app should have the following pages:

* welcome "page" (static content)
* images "page"
* about "page" (mostly static content)

You should also handle view state (detail, thumbnail, gallery) and it should load correctly
from the url

# Bonus

* Create a nested view in your about page that toggles between three "About"
topics (fictitious developers, or three about "facts")
